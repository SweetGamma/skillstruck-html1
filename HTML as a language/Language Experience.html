<h1>I visited China on a vacation with my family. We tried our best to talk to the people there. It was hard to understand when they spoke so fast! Many people helped me learn.</h1>

<h1>I read a picture book in Chinese. Writing in Chinese almost felt like drawing, with its long elegant marks that create meaning. I loved to try to understand the meaning behind the characters.</h1>

<h1> Chinese took a LOT of practice. I had to use a word or phrase over and over again before I felt like I had really learned it for good. I had to try hard not to get discouraged as I worked at it every day</h1>

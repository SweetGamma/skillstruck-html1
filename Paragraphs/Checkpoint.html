    <h1 style="color:blue">This is somewhat necessary?</h1>
    <p>
        Retuning to your homeland can never happen here in Eldorath.
        Consider this your new home here.
        I mean after all you will be here until the day you die after all and I am pretty sure you will die here. 
        Whether that would be from that of a bandit, natural caues, illness, or your own hands.
    </p>
    <h1 style="color:Red">Welcome to that of new</h1>
    <p>You that arrive on the boat of Eldorath. 
        I welcome you here but do not take my warning lightly. 
        After all the truth about not being able to return is very true. 
        You aren't able to go back but I do want to warn you not everyone will be your friend here!
        Good luck~ </p>

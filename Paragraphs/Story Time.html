       I, Kamari Stonebrook, the daughter of Dorran Stonebrook that origionally fell under the last name of Nedra.
       I now recall my past before here in Eldorath, it was rather fun and exciting.
       Thinking back to all that has happened to me.
       Here in Eldorath I never had a really good day here, it was a constant bad thing every single day.
       Which only added to the memories I had in my past, allowing them to just be fueled.
       I want to declare things about my father Dorran Stonebrook.

    <p style="font-family:Courier">
        The accusations of him courting two woman at the same time that has definetly happened.
        He decided it was best idea to also play with both of their feelings at this time. 
        On top of this he was barely around enough for both me and my sister Aurelia.
        Which was hurtful and impactful to me.
        Then again he is a very busy man constantly out doing things he needed to do as a High Arbiter.
        In the end it caused me to lose my own mind, and I still am loosing it!
